\section{Work objectives}
Why is ITER so large? How have been determined its main dimensions? Are these dimensions sufficient to reach its scientific goals,  i.e. produce 500 MW of fusion power for pulses of 400s with a power amplification ratio of 10\marginnote{\url{https://www.iter.org/sci/Goals}}? And what should be the size of tokamak fusion reactor: smaller or larger than ITER? How much additional power is required to reach positive power amplification? How does it affect the magnets and the plasma facing components? Should a fusion reactor be larger than ITER?

Answering these questions is the main motivation for this group work. During the few days dedicated to this work, you will have to answers some of these questions by working in small groups. Interactions between groups is highly encouraged: no one can be expert of all the various physical and technological fields required to build a fusion machine, so group work is essential. When necessary, results will be shared between groups.
